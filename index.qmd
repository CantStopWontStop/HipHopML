# Overview

Using machine learning and lyrics retrieved via the Genius API to classify songs as hip hop and RnB or not

## Potential Problem Questions

-   Determine whether a song is hip hop or RnB based on lyrics

# Data Sources

## Songs

-   Built a [web scrapper](analysis/wiki_scrapper.html) to get a list of Billboard's #1 Rap Songs from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_number-one_rap_singles_of_the_1980s_and_1990s)

-   Queried the [Genius API using geniusr R package](analysis/genius_api.html)

# Methods

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

-   [**Text mining**](analysis/text_mining.html) to clean and organize the lyrics into analyzable data

-   [**TF-IDF**](analysis/tfidf.html) to determine which words in each song separates that song from others

## Neural Networks

-   Use neural networks models to classify songs based on TF-IDF scores
