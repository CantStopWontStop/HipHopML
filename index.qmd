# Methods

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

-   **Text mining** to clean and organize the lyrics into analyzable data

-   **TF-IDF** to determine which words in each song separates that song from others

-   **Sentiment analysis** to score or categorize each song based on the sentiment of the lyrics, eg positive, negative, happy, sad, etc.

## Principle Component Analysis

-   **PCA** to determine which words

    -   were the most meaningful for each year

    -   separate rap from other genres...maybe just the clean words lol

## K-Means Clustering

-   **Clustering** to put rappers into categories based on lyrics

## Linear Regression

## Neural Networks
