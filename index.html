familiar highway, just a few miles out of town to that rundown one-room tavern that used to be my stomping ground well i pulled in the driveway, you know it all still looked the same and i couldn't wait to down a few and hear that jukebox ring but as i walked in through the doorway, there stood some kind of maitre d' well he looked me up and he looked me down, said \"may i help you please?\" and i said what'd you do with those swinging doors where's the sawdust on the floor why's everybody wearing suits and ties from where i stand i can't believe my eyes and whose idea what it to hang these ferns this brand new bar don't have a single burn i guess i'm somewhere that i don't belong i need a jukebox with a country song well i look back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud some fool was playing records, too fast, too long and too loud and it must have been a big mistake to try to speak my mind so as they were asking me to leave, i cried out one more time what'd you do with those swinging doors and where's the sawdust on the floor why's everybody wearing suits and ties from where i stand i can't believe my eyes and whose idea what it to hang these ferns this brand new
