'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life Who never knew how much I loved them Now I live with the regret That my true feelin's for them never were revealed So, I made a promise to myself To say each day how much she means to me And avoid that circumstance Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel 'Cause if tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one? And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes? So, tell that someone that you love Just what you're thinkin' of If tomorrow never comes

Is It Still Over?	Randy Travis	0	Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doin' fine Is it still over, are we still through? Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do Is it still over, are we still through? Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you Is it still over, are we still through? Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you If I repeat myself it's 'cause I've nothing else to do And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

Neon Moon	Brooks & Dunn	0	When the sun goes down on my side of town That lonesome feelin' comes to my door And the whole world turns Blue There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks I've got a table for two, way in the back Where I sit alone And think of losin' you I spend most every night Beneath the light of a neon moon Now if you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams dance In and out of the beams of a neon moon I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free I close my eyes and sometimes see You in the shadows Of this smoke-filled room No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried Or how many lies that I've lied Tellin' my poor heart She'll come back someday Oh, but I'll be alright As long as there's light from a neon moon Oh, if you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams dance In and out of the beams of a neon moon The jukebox plays on, drink by drink And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think And this hurt inside of me Ain't never gonna end Oh, but I'll be alright As long as there's light from a neon moon Oh, if you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon Come watch your broken dreams dance In and out of the beams of a neon moon Oh, watch your broken dreams dance In and out of the beams of a neon moon

And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he's too mainstream."" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use."" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?

That Summer	Garth Brooks	0	I went to work for her that summer A teenage kid so far from home She was a lonely widow woman Hell-bent to make it on her own We were a thousand miles from nowhere Wheat fields as far as I could see Both needin' somethin' from each other Not knowin' yet what that might be 'Til she came to me one evenin' Hot cup of coffee and a smile In a dress that I was certain She hadn't worn in quite a while There was a difference in her laughter There was a softness in her eyes And on the air, there was a hunger Even a boy could recognize She had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in her lover's eyes She had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night That summer wind was all around me Nothin' between us but the night And when I told her that I'd never She softly whispered that's alright And then I watched her hands of leather Turn to velvet in a touch There's never been another summer When I have ever learned so much We had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in each other's eyes We had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night I often think about that summer The sweat, the moonlight, and the lace And I have rarely held another When I haven't seen her face And every time I pass a wheat field And watch it dancin' with the wind Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel Her hungry arms again She had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in her lover's eyes She had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night

The Light	Disturbed	0	Like an unsung melody The truth is waiting there for you to find it It's not a blight, but a remedy A clear reminder of how it began Deep inside your memory You turned away as you struggled to find it You heard the call as you walked away A voice of calm from within the silence And for what seemed an eternity You waited hoping it would call out again You heard the shadow beckoning Then, your fear seemed to keep you blinded You held your guard as you walked away When you think all is forsaken Listen to me now (All's not forsaken) You need never feel broken again Sometimes, darkness can show you the light An unforgivable tragedy The answer isn't where you think you'd find it Prepare yourself for the reckoning For when your world seems to crumble again Don't be afraid, don't turn away You're the one who can redefine it Don't let hope become a memory Let the shadow permeate your mind And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away So that the door can be opened again Within your darkest memories Lies the answer, if you dare to find it Don't let hope become a memory When you think all is forsaken Listen to me now (All's not forsaken) You need never feel broken again Sometimes, darkness can show you the light Sickening, weakening Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul You need strengthening, toughening It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you Ignite the fire within you When you think all is forsaken Listen to me now (All's not forsaken) You need never feel broken again Sometimes, darkness can show you the light Don't ignore, listen to me now You need never feel broken again Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

The River	Garth Brooks	0	You know a dream is like a river Ever changin' as it flows And a dreamer's just a vessel That must follow where it goes Trying to learn from what's behind you And never knowing what's in store Makes each day a constant battle Just to stay between the shores And I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry Like a bird upon the wind These waters are my sky I'll never reach my destination If I never try So, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry Too many times we stand aside And let the waters slip away Till what we put off till tomorrow Has now become today So don't you sit upon the shoreline And say you're satisfied Choose to chance the rapids And dare to dance the tide Yes, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry Like a bird upon the wind These waters are my sky I'll never reach my destination If I never try So, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry And there's bound to be rough waters And I know I'll take some falls But with the good Lord as my captain I can make it through them all Yes, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry Like a bird upon the wind These waters are my sky I'll never reach my destination If I never try So, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry Yes, I will sail my vessel 'Til the river runs dry 'Til the river runs dry

The Sound of Silence	Disturbed	0	Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams, I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night and touched the sound of silence And in the naked light, I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never shared And no one dared disturb the sound of silence ""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words like silent raindrops, fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon God they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"" And whispered in the sound of silence

Would you yell it from the rooftops down?

Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love And the greatest is love And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
